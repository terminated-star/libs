# libs

Some libraries I made. 
All files in the `lib` directory were not made by me. 

## Features

- Single-header
- C89 (ANSI C)
- Few/no dependencies
- Can be used in C/C++

## Cons

- I am still learning C/C++
- There may be breaking changes at any time

## Libraries

`colors.h` - Library for storing and converting color models. 
Currently supports (partially): (RGB, HSV/HSB, HSL) 
Planned support: (CMYK) - We already have containers for these color models, but not conversion. 

## License
See the `LICENSE` file for the license. 
TLDR: `Unlicense` or `CC0`.
