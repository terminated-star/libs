# libs

Some libraries I made.\
All files in the `lib` directory, if any, were not made by me.\
I am open to creating more (small) libraries, open an issue to suggest one.

## Features

- Single-header
- C89 (ANSI C)
- Few/no dependencies
- Can be used in C/C++

## Cons

- I am still learning C/C++
- There may be breaking changes at any time

## Libraries

`colors.h` - Library for storing and converting color models.\
Currently supports (partially): RGB, HSV/HSB, HSL\
Planned support: CMYK, TSL\
`array_2d.h` - Represents a 2d grid. It _should_ work with any data type, and you aren't limited to one data type per array.

## License
See the `LICENSE` file for the license.\
TLDR: `Unlicense` or `CC0`.\
The license does not apply to files in the `lib` directory of this repository.
